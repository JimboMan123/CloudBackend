# CloudBackend
Backend used for cloud course project

This backend uses Node.js together with the Express framework to create endpoints. The backend uses routes and communicates with a Mysql database. 
Through GET or POST requests, a client can either fetch data or insert data into the database, via the backend. The backend both takes and returns JSON data.
